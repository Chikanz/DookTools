### DookTools
Some nice real functions I've hand picked from the far corners of the internet

### 3D mouse support
Just a slightly modified version of [this repo ](https://github.com/PatHightree/SpaceNavigator)

Allows control mode to be changed via Untiy shortcuts so that it can be changed from the mouse's radial menu[.](https://i.imgur.com/a1HeSm4.png)

### Animatey
Support class for changing simple values over time without all the boilerplate shit

### DookShortcuts
just some editor shortcuts I found real handy

`ctrl + G` to group objects

`ctrl + M` move currently selected object to in front of editor camera

`ctrl + Q` deselect all objects
